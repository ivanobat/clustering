This is a real business dataset from a large e-commerce company. The company has a global and diverse infrastructure which causes many identical products to be classified differently. To conduct sound and insightful product analysis, the company needs to be able to accurately cluster similar products. The dataset has 93 features for 10,000 products and the objective is to cluster the products in coherent groups. You will implement different clustering algorithms, at least one hard clustering and one soft clustering and compare your results. You are working in an unsupervised setting so you do not know the true number of groups and will have to use different statistics to pick an optimal number of groups.

* Loading libraries and data initial exploration
* Data preparation
* Hard clustering with Kmeans and PAM (Partitioning around mediods) built-in functions
  + Graphical exploration
  + Kmeans using eclust
  + PAM using eclust
  + Comparing kmeans and PAM with multiple k settings
  + What is the best K using KMeans and PAM
* Soft clustering
  + Soft clustering with mclust
  + Soft clustering with dbscan
  + Comparison hard vs soft clustering
  + Soft clustering projection in 2d for mclust
